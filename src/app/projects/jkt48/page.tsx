        Why I Chose JKT48 (and What It Taught Me About Emotional Product Design)

        This is a personal case study where I explore the fan economy and emotional product design through the lens of JKT48. As part of my
        Product Management portfolio, I analyzed how JKT48 builds loyalty through structure, rituals, and scarcity-based systems.

      <p className="text-base mb-6 leading-relaxed">
        I reflected on their business model and created a fictional PRD applying JKT48 emotional and operational design strategies
        into a tech context ‚Äî focusing on engagement, retention, and narrative design. This project is not just about idols,
        but about crafting meaningful experiences that users emotionally invest in.
